        <h3>Linh & Hai
          Intimate Wedding</h3>

        <p>Quynh Anh and her team at The Planners provided me with tremendous support and consulting throughout the
          planning process and wedding day. Quynh Anh was truly the best companion I could ask for!

          It almost felt like some sort of sixth sense connected our minds. I was quite impressed with the famous
          wedding scene in the movie Twilight but I had not talked to her about it. Nevertheless, what she proposed to
          me was significantly similar, or should I say even better!

          She was professional with her work which assured me that my wedding was in good hands. In fact, I enjoyed the
          planning process so much that after the wedding, I was sad thinking that the planning was over. I missed all
          the conversations that I had with her and we still keep in touch with each other.</p>

        <h3>Trang & Stephen
          Local Wedding</h3>
        <p>A BIG thank to The Planners Team for our beautiful, festive and emotional Wedding! We got what we wanted in
          our wedding: everybody had their good and memorial time! A super special appreciation to Thành & Quỳnh Anh for
          being the cutest, understanding and talented Wedding Planners we can ever ask for. The decoration from Quynh
          Anh was so incredible that we were surprised ourselves. Even though we saw it on the mood board before, we
          were still amazed by how accurate and beautiful all of the details turned out to be. Thành was very
          supportive, always listened to the bride and helped a lot in creating a timeline where we and the guests all
          had fun sharing many beautiful moments together.

          Above all, thank you Team for going through this journey with us, being understanding and knowing things that
          the couple didn’t know how to express. The “Love On Top” theme was one of them. Those little details like that
          are what make the Planners Team the best for us.</p>

        <h3>Eliza & Jason
          Traditional Ceremony & Wedding</h3>

        <p>Planning my wedding was so much less stressful, thanks to The Planners.

          For 7 months of the planning process, Van was my bridal stylist and sister. She always took care of me, my
          health and beauty, even when she was sick. She understands me and my taste so well, sends me inspo pics days
          and nights. Thank you so much for everything you did for us throughout the process!

          Biggest thank to Nhu and Tram who helped me create the gorgeous European-themed engagement party. You always
          collected and added such elegant details to the concept, helped me tirelessly with the styling and
          coordination for the party.

          Thank you, Thao, Linh and Quynh Anh, for helping me have the magnificent tea ceremony and grand wedding. You
          always listen to my desires, keep me updated on the progress, adjust to my wants and needs, pay attention to
          every little detail.

          Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to Thanh, Tu Anh, Duong, anh Linh, anh Son, Quang and Tho for helping
          out with the logistics, designing and visuals throughout my wedding events. You all made it so memorable for
          me and Jason!</p>

        <p>No matter how many times I could choose my wedding planner, I would go with The Planners every time. Once
          again, I thank the best wedding planner ever, Ms. Van Nguyen, for always finding solutions to all of our
          difficult requests. We can deeply feel your passion for wedding planning, your love for beautiful things and
